# NCPify ‚Äì Where Group Chats Ascendeth to Lore üéØ

### Project Description
NCPify is your daily ritual-powered, lore-driven pixel fantasy groupchat web experience.
It‚Äôs what happens when fandoms meet divine chaos and screenshots become sacred relics.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People send messages. 
Messages get ignored. 
Screenshots vanish into the void.
Where‚Äôs the drama? 
Where‚Äôs the lore? 
Where‚Äôs the *ritualistic reverence* for that ‚Äúyou up?‚Äù text?
We saw this existential crisis‚Ä¶ and **overreacted appropriately.** 

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
NCPify creates a secret society out of your groupchat screenshots.
Exaggerate messages into legendary lores
Rate each other‚Äôs drama
Perform daily pixelated rituals to gain entry
Unlock the Flipbook of Eternal Receipts
Basically, we turned texting into a sacred cult with leaderboard mechanics. You're welcome. ;)
